TTV3 Main Goals
	Standalone
		Reliance on EST and PT is annoying and makes updates difficult
		Making everything myself will take more upfront but updates later will be way easier
		Also gonna steal some ideas from TTM, EST, and PT
	Consistant Tree Sizes
		All trees will have 3 parts, totalling 3 adopts, 3 finishers, and 15 traditions.
	Performance Improvements
		TTV1 and TTV2 are VERY poorly made and I hate past me
	And just being a better mod in general

Plans for v3.0
	UI Rewrite
		Move Descriptions
		Add subtrees for the other 6 trees
	Do ALL the trees and get them functional
